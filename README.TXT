TechSupport - the DodgySoft Technical support system.

This project is part of the material for the book

   Objects First with Java - A Practical Introduction using BlueJ
   Seventh edition
   David J. Barnes and Michael Kölling

This project is discussed in chapter 6.


This project implements a technical support system for customers of the 
DodgySoft software company. Users can describe their software problems and 
get advice instantly!

The idea is based on Eliza - a famous program described by Joseph Weizenbaum 
in 1966. (Do a web search for "Eliza" and "Weizenbaum" if you want to know 
more about this.)

In fact, it is much more primitive than Eliza. But that's enough to match the 
quality of many software companies' technical support advice...  ;-)

To start this program, create a SupportSystem object and execute the "start" 
method.

Then start describing your problem by typing in the terminal window.

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate and study library classes, such 
as ArrayList, HashMap, HashSet, and Random.

putIfAbsent(key, value) only inserts the (key, value) pair if the key does not already exist in the map.

If the key is already present, it leaves the map unchanged.

The generated docs are accurate because they come directly from the source code and comments.

They are complete for public methods.
The useful parts are class descriptions, method purposes, parameter and return info.

The not so useful parts are private methods/fields often don’t show,
 so it may feel incomplete.
 
Usually no errors, but if comments are missing or unclear, the docs won’t help much.

@author shows who wrote the class.

@version shows version info.

@return explains what a method returns.

48.

@see links to another class or method.

@throws explains when an exception can happen.

@deprecated marks something as outdated.
